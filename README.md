Pariah is my entry for the [Js13kGames compo](http://js13kgames.com/), a JavaScript coding competition
for HTML5 Game Developers where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13
kilobytes. The actual size of the game is **12793 bytes**

Pariah is set in a world where the destiny of humanity it's on the hands of one
man that was rejected by society, labeled as crazy and locked up into a
dungeon. Is the story of the last man in earth.
